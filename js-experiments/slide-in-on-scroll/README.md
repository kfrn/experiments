Main learning points:

* When scrolling down a page, the images slide into place.
* Working out the logic of when that should kick in
* `window` properties: `.scrollY` etc
* Image properties - `offsetTop` etc
* Debouncer function (supplied) - useful to slow down rate of response to events
* CSS - animations (look at supplied CSS files)

Gimmicky effect, I don't really like it, but interesting to do.
