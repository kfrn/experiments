Main learning points:

* Understanding HTML5 video
* Some really nice CSS (supplied)
* Video progress bar, ability to skip, speed up, change volume
* HTML5 video attributes
* Scrub thru video - nice way to do this

Continuing exercise:

* Play/pause via spacebar
* Progress bar starts at zero (previously: 50%)
* Add volume and speed buttons
* Add button to make fullscreen

To do:

* How to click button to make it not fullscreen?
* BUG: video won't start with a space press, although space works to pause/play once the video is already playing.
